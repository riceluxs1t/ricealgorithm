  - Sort the boxes from smallest to biggest.
  - starting from the smallest box i, find max of consecutive equal size box.
  n
  - go through the array and use dictionary to count number of boxes in each size and return max.

-It has no cycles and has N nodes and N - 1 edges.
    True. 
    base case: 1 node 0 edge is a tree
               2 node 1 edge is a tree
    Inductive step: 
               Assume tree with k nodes has k - 1 edges.
               assume a tree with k + 1 nodes. Remove a leaf node. Because leaf node has degree 1,
               the tree will have k nodes with k -1 edges. 
    
    A graph with n nodes require at least n - 1 edges to be connected. 
    This means that if a graph has more than n -1 edges, there must be a cycle. Also if a graph has less than n-1 edges,
    then the graph is disconnected. Therefore, a graph with n nodes, n- 1 edges that is connected must have no cycle. Also, a connected
    graph with n nodes without any cycle must contain n-1 edges.


-It has N nodes and N - 1 edges and all the nodes are connected. i.e. you can get from node i to node j for any pair (i, j)
    True. A tree must have N - 1 edges. Thus, forming a graph with n-1 edges, and no cycles, the graph must be connected. 
    
 
-It has no cycles and it is connected.
    As proven, a tree must contain n - 1 edges. The least number of edges we need to form a connected graph with n nodes is n -1 edges.
    In order to form a connected graph with n - 1 edges, the graph must contain no cycles.

- Dp
  DP[i][0] = maximum sum possible starting from node i including node i.
  DP[i][1] = maximum sum possible starting from node i not including node i.
  DP[i][0] = (sum(DP[j][1]) for all i's children nodes j
  DP[i][1] = (sum(DP[j][0] + i.value) for all i's children nodes j
  return max(DP[root][0], DP[root][1])
  
3. 
M[i, j] = the maximum number of cities that you can go sightseeing in if you have reached citi i by time j.
F[i, j] = the earlist time you can reach citi i after having gone sightseeing at exactly j different cities.
