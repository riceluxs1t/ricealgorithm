# COMP 382 training

This repoistory serves as a place for consolidating 1) problems we went over in each session 2) our analysis for each problem and 3) each person's implementations for some or all of the problems.

# Session 1. 10.26.17'

## Problem 1)
	Given a set of x coordinates x1, x2, ..., xn and some rewards associated with each coordinate r1, r2, ..., rn, find the subset of x coordinates such that x_(i+1) - x_i >= 5 and the sum of corresponding r_i for each element in the subset is maximized.

	Approach 1)
		TODO: fill this out

	Approach 2)
		TODO: fill this out
	
	Approach 3)
		TODO: fill this out

## Problem 2)
	Same problem as Problem 1 with the added constraint that the subset has to be exactly of some given size K.

## Problem 3)
	Same problem as problem 2 except that the the subset can be of size upto some given size K.
